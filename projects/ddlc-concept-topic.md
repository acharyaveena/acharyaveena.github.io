The Document Development Lifecycle (DDLC) is a structured approach to planning, creating, reviewing,
and maintaining documentation.
Just like software development follows Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), the DDLC follows the

needs of its intended audience.

**Phases in DDLC**

The DDLC includes below phases:

1. Analyze
    - Assess tasks before starting.
    - Research about the task and find its impact on other features.
  
2. Design
    - Plan the document structure (TOC).
    - Write a brief introduction as a concept topic.

3. Develop
    - Write the document content using topic based authoring techniques.
    - Use screen shots and diagrams as needed.

4. Review
    - Get reviews from SME.
    - Get reviews from peers and rework on review comments.

5. Publish
    - Close tasks
    - Thank your reviewers and publish the document.

6. Maintain
    - Keep the document up-to-date.
    - Ensure hyperlinks are valid.
    - Make sure that no 404 or 500 errors show up in the document.
