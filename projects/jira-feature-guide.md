## Introduction


Jira Software by Atlassian is a leading tool for task and issue tracking, and Agile project management. Tasks are the basic building blocks for managing work within a project. They represent individual units of work that you need to track, assign, and complete. Jira supports various issue types, such as tasks, bugs, stories, and epics, allowing teams to tailor the system to their specific needs.

This guide provides an overview of Jira’s task management features, with instructions to create, assign, view, and close work items.

### Task Lifecycle
